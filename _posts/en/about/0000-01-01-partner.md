<p class="text text-119">Yet we are not a charity. We believe in the power of business. Business can be a strong force of good, if you want it to. In order to make a difference, we have to work out a profit margin through providing a value to people and the businesses around us. We also strongly believe in the transformative power of a societal perspective on business: One that serves a social need by maximizing on the return on impact, not on private profits.
	Some call it „Benefit Corporation“, „Social Entrepreneurship“,  or being a „Change Maker“. We think of it as running a business to do good.

	If this sounds like the foundation of your business, we would be happy to hear from you
	- to find out if we can work on a follow up as a partnership.
