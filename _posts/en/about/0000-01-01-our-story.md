				<h2>How it all started</h2>
				<p>The idea for Eaternity was born in November 2008 at the ETH ZÃ¼rich when Judith Ellens, Eaternity Co-Founder and CSO, won <a href="http://archiv2.sustainability.ethz.ch/stimmen/ellens.html">first prize at the ecoworks-workshop</a> for her idea to measure and reduce the impact of food in restaurants. At that time food was widely ignored in discussions on how to reduce our footprint on the planet. Since then Eaternity has been working hard to bring this to the attention of key interest groups. After a year of lobbying and hard work Eaternity launched its <a href="/assets/de/2009-11-25 MM-Pilot.pdf">first project at one of the ETH canteens</a> at the Science City campus run by SV Group. This project was the first of its kind, truly pioneering, and the start of many more great projects to come. The CO2-impact of all the meals offered at the canteen was calculated and the team worked together with the cooks to create and serve the first ever climate-friendly menu in a public restaurant. After this voluntary work continued under the Eaternity Association and other project requests, as well as media interest, began to materialise. We embraced many opportunities (<a href="http://eaternity.ch/blog/">and still do!</a>) to reach out to numerous persons by giving lectures and interviews, providing materials, organizing events, setting up information booths and offering more menu calculations. Based on all these valuable experiences we incorporated (in addition to the <a href="http://eaternity.ch">Eaternity Association</a>) the Eaternity AG in July 2014. This company supports players in the restaurant industry, providing them with the expertise and tools to turn restaurants into  climate heroes.</p>
				<p>Along the way we had some exciting times. Hear more about them from our Co-Founder and CEO, Manuel Klarmann and watch our great TEDx talk (11min).</p>
