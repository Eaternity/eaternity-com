			<p>The idea of Eaternity was born in November 2008 where it won the first price at the ETH ecoworks workshop. After one year of lobbying and hard work we carried out our first project at one of the ETH canteens, the Science City campus restaurant run by SV Group. We calculated the CO2-impact and offered a year later during three weeks the first ever climate-friendly menus in a public restaurant. Since then we continued on a voluntarily basis under the Eaternity Association as media and other project requests found their way to us. By giving lectures and interviews, providing materials, organizing events, putting up information booths and offering more climate-friendly menus we took great joy in reaching out to numerous people.&nbsp;</p>
