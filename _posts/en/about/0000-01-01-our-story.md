				<h2>We have an Appetite for Change.</h2>
				<p>The idea for Eaternity was born in November 2008 at the ETH ZÃ¼rich when Judith Ellens, Eaternity Co-Founder and CSO, won first prize at the ecoworks-workshop for her idea to measure and reduce the impact of food in restaurants. At that time food was widely ignored in discussions on how to reduce our footprint on the planet. Since then Eaternity has been working hard to bring this to the attention of key interest groups. After a year of lobbying and hard work Eaternity launched its first project at one of the ETH canteens at the Science City campus run by SV Group. This project was the first of its kind, truly pioneering, and the start of many more great projects to come. The CO2-impact of all the meals offered at the canteen was calculated and the team worked together with the cooks to create and serve the first ever climate-friendly menu in a public restaurant. After this voluntary work continued under the Eaternity Association  and other project requests, as well as media interest, began to materialise. Every opportunity to reach out to numerous persons by giving lectures and interviews, providing materials, organizing events, setting up information booths and offering more menu calculations was embraced (it still is!) and based on all these valuable experiences we had the courage to found, in addition to the Association, Eaternity AG in July 2014.  Eaternity support players inthe restaurant industry, providing them with the expertise and tools to turn restaurants into true climate heroes. </p>
				<p>Along the way we had some exciting times and decisions to make.  Hear about them from Co-Founder and CEO, Manuel Klarmann:</p>
