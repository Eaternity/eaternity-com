			<p class="text text-38">Eaternity is the company behind creating the Eaternity Cloud, a comprehensive management solution for the gastronomy to give you smart insights into your supply-chain for decisions that benefit people, planet and profits.

				We went public in 2014 - our office is based in Zurich, Switzerland. Our story goes back to 2008.</p>

			<p class="text text-53">We have an Appetite for Change.</p>
			<p class="text text-57">We’re designers, programmers, tinkerers, writers, speakers, bikers, engineers, runners, developers, chefs, analysts, campers, musicians, hikers, photographers, readers, travelers, gardeners, volunteers, and hard workers.

				With such a diverse group of people, we bring a unique perspective to everything we do.
			</p>
			<p class="text text-63">We know how to run a restaurant. </p>
			<div class="text text-71">
				<p>We are experts in gastronomy. We take great detail in understanding the daily needs and processes of the different cooks and restaurant managers. Over the years we have taken a close look at over a hundred restaurants and worked together with their cooks to keep designing an integrated software experience that is truly unique to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We have been fortunate to earn the repeat business of many of out customers including some of the world’s largest - and smallest - companies.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>It’s rare that a business tool is equally popular with the big guys and the small guys, but Eaternity Cloud is that kind of tool. Check out, our references. Freelancers, small shops, mid-sized companies, and multinationals all rely on Eaternity Cloud.

			<p class="text text-78">We work accurate and think scientific. </p>
			<div class="text text-80">
				<p>When it comes to our planet, we look at the facts. We see it as evident, that we will run out of resources in the long run, if we do not happen to act swift and efficient in the short run.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We believe in the scientific method to guide the path through the fogs of complexity, information overload, misleading advertisements and human habits of ignorance.</p>
				<p>Together with great scientific partnerships we distill solid estimates on what decision factually matter when it comes to food and sustainability. And work on making them available to the world as a free and open-source lca data-platform (edb.eaternity.ch) with the goal to find more collaborators.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="text text-82">We embrace technology. </p>
			<div class="text text-86">
				<p>7 billion people, that’s quite a lot. Even so we are just a hand full of people working at Eaternity, we can grasp the opportunity to be part of something really meaningful. By stand on the shoulders of giants and embracing the tools that modern software technology provides us.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We don’t believe there is a magic-technology solution to climate change. Yet we believe, that we can develop technologies that address the needs of people, and give them the leverage to become themselves the solution through empowerment and facilitation.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="text text-91">We believe in the beauty of simple. </p>
			<div class="text text-98">
				<p>We’re big believers in the power of keeping it simple. And we understand that smart technology also needs to be beautiful technology.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>Unsere Software folgt der Design-Philosophie, dass der Mensch im Mittelpunkt steht – je einfacher und intuitiver die Bedienung der Anwendung ist, desto erfolgreicher und erfüllender gestaltet sich die Arbeit.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>In the decades to come, we’ll continue to make big bets on simplicity, clarity, ease-of-use, and honesty. This goes for our products, our publications, and our company.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="text text-107">We give a damn. </p>
			<div class="text text-113">
				<p>Treating people right is fundamental to how we do business. We treat our customers as we’d want to be treated, we treat each other like family, and we treat ourselves to a good day’s work and a good night’s sleep.&nbsp;</p>
