				<h2>Why food is important</h2>

				<p>In Europe our food choices are responsible for 30% of greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption. In Switzerland this accounts for more than 2.7 tons of CO₂ per person each year. In addition, scarcity of resources (e.g. fertile land and fresh water) together with an increasing world population makes sustainable production and fair distribution and consumption of food and resources one of the most pressing issues of our time.</p>
				<p>With an abundance of information on the environmental impact of the food chain the market is increasingly demanding action and smart solutions. By working together we can reduce food related emissions by at least 50%. For example if everyone in Switzerland ate 3 climate-friendly meals per week more than 1 million tons of CO2 would be saved. This would have an equivalent impact of 370,000 less cars on the road. This is a huge impact.	</p>
				<p>Eaternity’s core business is to support the restaurant industry in becoming true climate and sustainability leaders. One restaurant reaches many people and with each additional restaurant we work with our impact grows. Partner with Eaternity and make an impact.</p>
